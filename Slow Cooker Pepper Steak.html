  <strong>slow cooker pepper steak always comes out tender and flavorful and is one of our family's favorites. It's great to make ahead of time and serve over rice, egg noodles, or chow mein.</strong>

  <p><em>Pepper steak is a Chinese-inspired meal with plenty of sauce, bell peppers, and onions. This is a stir-fry-style meal but made in the slow cooker! Wonderful served over rice and has plenty of sauce (or gravy) to go around.</em>
